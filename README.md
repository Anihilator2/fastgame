# Fast Game

Server that applies small performance tweaks that should be good for games. It uses the kernel
Process Events Connector to receive the pid of processes created after FastGame was started. If the process name
matches one of the games in our config file small tunings are applied.

This is a project I started for fun and for learning purposes. No intention of competing with more mature tools like
Feral Game Mode.
